<h1> The Best Movies According to Sam </h1>

<h2> My top 3 movies of all-time. </h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Last Samurai</h3>
<p>I really love the scenery in ancient Japan, the rich culture and humble
    people. Follow the way of Samurai with pride and discipline which is hard
    to find in the world today.
</p>

<h3>Kung Fu Panda</h3>
<p>This movie has lot of cultural influence of ancient China. Quite humorous way 
    to teach you about self acceptance and respect.
</p>

<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>Action packed drama between humans and machines. Has a deep meaning within
    the war that tries reflects our reality quite accurately. Great to watch 
    with children especially boys.
